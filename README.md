# Port Scanner Project

## Introduction
A port scanner is a security tool used to detect open ports on a target system. It helps network administrators and security professionals identify potential vulnerabilities by scanning for available services and detecting unauthorized access points.

## Features
- Scans for open ports on a specified target
- Supports TCP and UDP scanning
- Provides detailed information on detected services
- Adjustable scanning speed and timeout settings
- Logs results for further analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (recommended)
- Required dependencies (install using `requirements.txt`)
- A Linux-based system (preferred) or Windows with Python installed

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/port-scanner.git
   cd port-scanner
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the port scanner:
   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py -t <target_ip> -p <port_range>
   ```

## Usage
- Specify the target IP and port range to scan.
- Use `-u` for UDP scanning and `-t` for TCP scanning.
- Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory.
- Optionally, integrate with an external alerting system.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure you have permission before scanning any network.
- Do not use this tool for malicious purposes.
- Run in a controlled environment to avoid unintended disruptions.
